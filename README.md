# Bobby Zhao Sheng Lo - Online CV

This repository contains the source code for the personal website and online CV of Bobby Zhao Sheng Lo, MD, PhD.

## Description

This is a simple, static website designed to showcase Dr. Lo's professional profile, including his education, awards, research projects, and a comprehensive list of his peer-reviewed publications. The website is designed to be clean, professional, and easy to navigate.

## Features

*   **Homepage:** A summary of Dr. Lo's profile.
*   **Publications Page:** A complete list of publications, automatically updated from Google Scholar.
*   **Automated Updates:** A GitHub Action is set up to automatically update the publications list every week.

## Setup

The website is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The publications list is generated by a Python script.

To run the project locally, you will need to have Python installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Generate the publications list:**
    ```bash
    python generate_publications_ghibli.py
    ```
4.  **Open `index.html` in your browser to view the website.**

## Automated Publication Updates

A GitHub Action is configured to run the `generate_publications_ghibli.py` script once a week (every Sunday at midnight). This script fetches the latest publications from Dr. Lo's Google Scholar profile and updates the `publications.html` file.

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/update-publications.yml`. If any changes are made to the publications list, the action will automatically commit the updated `publications.html` file to the `main` branch.
